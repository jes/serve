1. Compiling
------------

Open the file "Makefile" in your favourite text editor and configure the
following options to your tastes.

#Enable this to use libmagic for automatic mimetype detection
LIBMAGIC=no
#Enable this to use zlib for gzip compression
ZLIB=no
#Enable this to use the sendfile() function instead of read()/write()
SENDFILE=no
#Set this to the bin directory you want serve installed in
BINDIR=/usr/bin
#Set this to the directory you want serve_mimetypes installed in
ETCDIR=/etc

After configuring these options run "make".
If all goes according to plan the serve binary should be available in src/serve.

You can now run "make install" as root to install the server binary to
$BINDIR/serve and the mimetypes file to /etc/serve_mimetypes.

2. Testing
----------

After you've compiled and installed serve, you are ready to run it. To test it
out, try:

$ cd ~/public_html
$ serve

and go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to check that it's working.

3. Running at boot
------------------

Once you're satisfied that serve itself is working, and if you want it to run
automatically at boot, you will need to write an init script that does something
like this:

 cd $DOC_ROOT
 serve -d -p$PORT -u$USER -g$GROUP -P$PIDFILE -s$HOST >>$LOGFILE 2>>$ERRFILE

The options are as follows:
 -d       Daemonize
 $PORT    Set the TCP port to listen on (e.g. 80)
 $USER    Set the username to setuid to (e.g www-data)
 $GROUP   Set the group name to setgid to (e.g. www-data)
 $PIDFILE Set the path to write a pidfile in (e.g. /var/run/serve.pid)
 $HOST    Set the hostname of the server (sometimes useful for HTTP/1.0 clients)
 $DOC_ROOT Set the location of the root directory (e.g. /var/www)
 $LOGFILE Redirects stdout to the log file (e.g. /var/log/serve.out)
 $ERRFILE Redirects stderr to the error file (e.g. /var/log/serve.err)

See the output of "serve -h" for more options.

The script that kills serve at shutdown should do something like:
 kill `cat $PIDFILE`

4. Mimetype configuration
-------------------------

Even if you compiled serve with libmagic enabled, you will still need a
mimetypes file if you want serve to automatically find index pages. When looking
for an index page, serve goes down the list of file extensions specified in
$DOC_ROOT/.mimetypes, and then /etc/serve_mimetypes (in that order),
trying "index.EXT" where EXT is an extension loaded from those files. The first
existing file that serve can open for reading is used.

$DOC_ROOT is whatever directory serve was started from.

If you want to specify another mimetypes file to serve, in addition to the two
mentioned above, you can give serve the -m option, like so:

$ serve -m ~/my_mimetypes

Serve will use mimetypes in this file in preference to those in the other files.
If you specify several -m options, the later ones are given higher preference
than the earlier ones.

Note that when you change a mimetypes file, you will need to restart serve if
you want it to reload the file.
